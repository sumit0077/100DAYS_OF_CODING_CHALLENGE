You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
if(n==1) return 1;
        if(n==2) return 2;

        int[] a =  new int[n];
        a[0]=1;
        a[1]=2;

        for(int i=2;i<n;i++){
            a[i]=a[i-1]+a[i-2];
        }
        return a[n-1];
